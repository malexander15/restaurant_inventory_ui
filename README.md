# Restaurant Inventory UI

A Next.js frontend for interacting with the Restaurant Inventory API.

This project is a frontend client built with Next.js that consumes a Rails API
to manage restaurant inventory, recipes, and stock depletion.

The UI is intentionally decoupled from the backend and communicates exclusively
via HTTP requests to a versioned REST API.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js (App Router)
- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Fetch API

## Backend Dependency

This UI depends on the Restaurant Inventory API.

The backend must be running locally for the UI to function.

Default backend URL:
http://localhost:3001/api/v1

http://localhost:3001/api/v1
